Features⚙️:
The project uses Bootstrap 5 for a fast, mobile-first responsive design. The sticky dark navbar includes the brand and smooth scrolling links. The homepage displays a responsive grid layout using Bootstrap’s grid system with cards that contain an image, title, description, and a “Read More” button. The layout has carefully applied spacing and coloring for a clean, professional look. Navigation links smoothly scroll to the respective sections, including Home (cards), About, and Contact. The entire site is fully responsive across different screen sizes. A footer provides useful links and copyright information.
Usage🚀:
To use the project, simply open the HTML file in any modern web browser. Navigate through the site using the navbar; clicking the links will smoothly scroll to the relevant sections. The card grid adjusts automatically depending on the screen size, making it easy to view on desktop, tablet, or mobile. You can customize the content by editing the card titles, descriptions, images, and links directly in the HTML file.
Technologies Used🛠️:
This project is built using HTML5 and CSS3 with Bootstrap 5 included via CDN links. The Bootstrap JS bundle is used for responsive navbar toggling and other interactive components. There are no build tools or servers required; just open the index.html file in a browser to see everything in action.
CDN Links🌐:
The Bootstrap CSS is loaded from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css and the Bootstrap JS bundle (which includes Popper) is loaded from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js.
Customization🎨:
For customization, you can replace the card images with your own URLs or local files, modify the card titles and descriptions inside the .card-body elements, adjust Bootstrap classes to change layouts or spacing, and add more sections with matching IDs to enable smooth scrolling navigation.
